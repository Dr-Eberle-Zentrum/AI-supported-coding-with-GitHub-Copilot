## Introduction

The `ellmer` package provides a powerful interface for integrating large language models (LLMs) into R workflows. This enables you to leverage AI capabilities directly within your data processing pipelines, combining traditional statistical computing with modern AI assistance.

## What is ellmer?

`ellmer` is an R package that provides a unified interface to various LLM providers, including:

- GitHub Copilot (via GitHub Models)
- OpenAI models
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- Local models via Ollama

It allows you to:

- Send prompts to AI models from R code
- Process text data with AI assistance
- Generate structured outputs
- Stream responses for interactive applications

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Why Use ellmer?

- **Unified API**: Work with different AI providers using consistent syntax
- **Pipeline Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate AI into tidyverse workflows
- **Reproducible**: Track prompts and model versions for reproducible research
- **Flexible**: Switch between models without rewriting code

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Installing ellmer

First, install the `ellmer` package from CRAN or GitHub:

```r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("ellmer")

# Or install development version from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tidyverse/ellmer")
```

Load the package:

```r
library(ellmer)
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation
```


## Setting Up ellmer with Ollama

To use `ellmer` with Ollama, i.e. a local LLM on your machine, you need to install Ollama and set up a local model.

### Step 1: Install and start Ollama

Go to [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

**Important:** *Start the Ollama program/server on your machine before proceeding to the next step.*

### Step 2: Download a Local Model

Typically, you will want to choose a model that fits your computational resources and needs.
For this, you have to know that larger models require more RAM  and processing power, while smaller models are faster but may have lower accuracy.
Furthermore, higher computation speed can only be achieved using a GPU (from your graphics card with a large VRAM of its own), while CPU-only machines will be slower.
Thus, most models are not suitable for CPU-only machines, and you should check the model requirements before downloading.

You can browse the list of available models on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/models) and choose one that fits your needs.

Here, we suggest the [`phi4-mini:3.8b` model](https://ollama.com/library/phi4-mini) (~2.5GB space on your harddrive), which comprises about 3.8 billion parameters and is suitable for CPU-only machines with at least 16GB RAM.

To download a model, either use the 

- Ollama chat GUI (Graphical User Interface), i.e. model selection in the chat, or 
- the command line interface (CLI).

### Step 3: Initialize a Chat Object

Given Ollama is running and you have downloaded a model, you can now initialize a chat object in R:

```r
chat <- chat_ollama(model = "phi4-mini:3.8b")  # replace with your chosen model
```

To make an LLM more deterministic in its responses and thus usable in a scientific context, you can set respective parameters.

- `temperature` : defines the "randomness" of the answers, where "0" is more deterministic and "2" is more random. For reproducible results, set it to 0.
- `top_k` : defines the number of most likely next words to consider for the next word prediction. For reproducible results, set it to 1.

```r
chat <- 
  chat_ollama(
    model = "phi4-mini:3.8b",  # replace with your chosen model
    temperature = 0,
    top_k = 1,
    seed = 42  # optional: set a seed for reproducibility of random number generation
  )
```




## Setting Up ellmer with GitHub Copilot

To use `ellmer` with GitHub Copilot (via GitHub Models), you need to set up authentication.


### Step 1-pat: Getting Access to GitHub Models

Given that we have already *registered our GitHub account in RStudio*, to use the 
GitHub Copilot features, we can **proceed to use the GitHub Models via `ellmer` without further actions**.



### Step 1-explicit: Get a GitHub Token and Store It Securely

**The following steps are only needed, if you have not already set up GitHub authentication in RStudio.**

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "ellmer-access")
4. Select the required scopes (typically `repo` and `user`)
5. Click "Generate token" and copy it immediately

Store your token securely in your R environment:

```r
# Option 1: Set for the current session
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_TOKEN = "your-token-here")

# Option 2: Store permanently in .Renviron
usethis::edit_r_environ()
# Add this line: GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token-here
# Save and restart R
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Security Best Practice

Never commit tokens or API keys to your code! Always use environment variables and add `.Renviron` to your `.gitignore` file.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Step 2: Initialize a Chat Object

```r
# Create a chat session with GitHub Copilot
chat <- chat_github()  # the used default model will be printed

# Test the connection
chat$chat("Hi, please give me a joke!")
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Setup and Test `ellmer`

1. Install the `ellmer` package
2. Create a chat object and send a test message
3. Verify you receive a response and enjoy your joke..
4. What do you see, when you print your `chat` object?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Solution

Printing the `chat` object shows 

- the model being used
- the number of tokens sent and received
- the total cost incurred (if applicable)
- the history of messages exchanged

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Using AI for Data Processing

### Basic Text Processing

Process individual text strings with AI:

```r
# Classify sentiment
texts <- c(
  "I love this product!",
  "This is terrible.",
  "It's okay, not great."
)

# Use AI to classify sentiment
chat <- chat_github()
# iterative call of chat interface using sapply() or purrr::map()
results <- purrr::map_chr(texts, 
  function(text) {
    chat$chat(
      paste("Classify the sentiment (positive/negative/neutral):", text)
    )
  })
```

### Processing Data in Pipelines

Integrate AI into tidyverse pipelines:

```r

# Example: Customer feedback analysis
feedback_data <- tibble(
  id = 1:5,
  comment = c(
    "I had a wonderful experience with the customer support team. The service was absolutely great, and the representative went above and beyond to be helpful and answer all my questions quickly.",
    "I was really disappointed by the long wait times I experienced today. I had to sit on hold for over forty minutes just to speak with someone, which left me very unhappy.",
    "My visit was just an average experience overall. The product works fine and the staff was polite enough, but nothing really stood out to make it a memorable or exceptional interaction.",
    "I am incredibly impressed with this purchase! The item is of excellent quality, and the fast delivery exceeded my expectations, arriving a full two days earlier than the estimated date.",
    "I was so excited for this item to get here, but unfortunately, the product arrived damaged due to poor packaging. I will need to contact customer support immediately for a replacement."
  )
)

# Add AI-powered sentiment analysis
feedback_processed <- feedback_data %>%
  rowwise() %>% # ensures each row/information is processed individually
  mutate(
    sentiment = chat$chat(
      paste("Classify as positive/negative/neutral:", comment)
      , echo="none" # supress printing of the result in the console
    ),
    key_themes = chat$chat(
      paste("Extract main themes (max 3 words):", comment)
      , echo="none" # supress printing of the result in the console
    )
  )
```

### Aggregated calls to reduce IO and number of prompts

So far, one `chat()` call (prompt) was made per row.

An alternative is to aggregate multiple inputs into a single prompt, reducing the number of API calls:

```r
feedback_data |> 
  mutate(
    mood = 
      comment |> 
      str_c(collapse="#") |> 
      chat$chat( "Assign to each product feedback answer (provided as #-separated list) a respective category from (happy,unhappy) in a #-separated aggregated text output",
                      echo = "none") |> 
      str_split_1("#")
  )
```

That way, only one API call is made for the entire dataset.

But when working on larger datasets, be aware of token limits per prompt (both input and output tokens).



::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Rate Limits and Costs

Be aware of:

- API rate limits for your chosen provider (limited number of requests per minute/hour)
- Limited token quotas and prompt sizes
- Potential costs for API calls
- Processing time for large datasets
- Consider batching requests when possible (less tokens spent)


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Advanced: Structured Output Generation

Request structured data from AI models:

```r
# Extract structured information
extract_info <- function(text) {
  prompt <- paste0(
    "Extract the following from this text and return as JSON:\n",
    "- sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)\n",
    "- urgency (high/medium/low)\n",
    "- category (product/service/delivery/other)\n\n",
    "Text: ", text
  )
  
  chat$chat(prompt)
}

# Apply to dataset
feedback_structured <- feedback_data %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(analysis = extract_info(comment))
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 2: Build a Data Processing Pipeline

Create a tidyverse pipeline that:

1. creates a `tibble` dataset (columns `review_id` and `text`) with the following product reviews
  - *The software is intuitive but lacks some features. Rating: 4/5*
  - *Terrible experience, crashed multiple times. Very disappointed.*
  - *Perfect for my needs! Easy to use and fast. Highly recommend.*
2. Uses AI to classify the main topic of each review in up to two words
3. Extracts a numerical satisfaction score (1-5) from the text

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Example Solution

```r
library(ellmer)
library(tidyverse)

# Sample data
reviews <- tibble(
  review_id = 1:3,
  text = c(
    "The software is intuitive but lacks some features. Rating: 4/5",
    "Terrible experience, crashed multiple times. Very disappointed.",
    "Perfect for my needs! Easy to use and fast. Highly recommend."
  )
)

# Initialize chat
chat <- chat_github()

# Process with AI
reviews %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    topic = chat$chat(paste("Main topic (1-2 words):", text)),
    score = chat$chat(paste("Satisfaction score 1-5:", text)),
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## Local LLMs

So far, we have focused on cloud-based AI models like GitHub Copilot.
Thus, our setup required internet access and API tokens.
Since the latter may incur costs and have rate limits, local models can be a viable alternative for some use cases.
This is especially true for high-volume applications or sensitive data.
Furthermore, this reduces dependency on external services and the costs associated with them.

To use local models with `ellmer`, you can leverage [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), which allows you to run LLMs on your local machine.

The general steps are:

1. Install Ollama and set up a local model that fits both your **computational resources and needs**
2. Install the `ellmer` package
3. Initialize a chat object for the local model

A detailed guide for setting up Ollama with `ellmer` can be found in the 

- [POSIT Blog post on "Setting up local LLMs for R and Python"](https://posit.co/blog/setting-up-local-llms-for-r-and-python/) (*Jan 2026*) and the 
- [ellmer `chat_ollama` documentation](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/chat_ollama.html).



## Best Practices for AI in Pipelines

### 1. Design Clear Prompts

```r
# Good: Specific and constrained
prompt <- "Classify sentiment as: positive, negative, or neutral. 
          Return only one word."

# Less effective: Vague
prompt <- "What do you think about this?"
```

### 2. Handle Errors Gracefully

```r
safe_chat <- function(chat, prompt) {
  tryCatch(
    chat$chat(prompt),
    error = function(e) {
      warning("API call failed: ", e$message)
      return(NA)
    }
  )
}

# Use in pipeline
data %>%
  mutate(ai_result = safe_chat(chat, prompt))
```

This is especially important when working with large datasets or unreliable network connections.

### 3. Cache Results

Write your AI-generated data to file to avoid redundant calls:

```r
# Save processed results to avoid reprocessing
processed_data <- data %>%
  mutate(ai_field = process_with_ai(text))

# Save to disk
write_rds(processed_data, "cache/processed_data.rds")

# Load cached version later
processed_data <- read_rds("cache/processed_data.rds")
```

This reduces redundant API calls and speeds up data processing.

You might even want to write your script in a way, that it first checks, whether a cached version exists, and only processes the data if not.
That way, you can easily re-run your whole analysis without incurring additional costs or delays.

### 4. Use Batch Processing for Large Datasets

```r
# Process in chunks to manage rate limits
process_in_batches <- function(data, batch_size = 10) {
  data %>%
    mutate(batch = ceiling(row_number() / batch_size)) %>%
    group_by(batch) %>%
    mutate(ai_result = process_with_ai(text)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    select(-batch)
}
```

This approach is especially useful for large datasets to avoid hitting API rate limits.

Furthermore, it can be nicely combined with the "aggregated calls" approach shown earlier.


## Reproducibility Considerations

Document your AI pipeline for reproducibility:

```r
# Initialize chat
chat <- chat_github()

# Record model and version
metadata <- list(
  model = chat$get_model(),
  provider = "github",
  date = Sys.Date(),
  ellmer_version = packageVersion("ellmer"),
  prompt_template = "Classify sentiment: {text}"
)

# Save with results
list(
  data = processed_data,
  metadata = metadata
) %>%
  write_rds("results_with_metadata.rds")
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Group Discussion

Consider the following questions for discussion within the class:

- What types of data processing tasks in your work could benefit from AI integration?
- How would you balance reproducibility with using AI models that may change over time?
- What ethical considerations arise when using AI to process data?
- How do you validate the quality of AI-generated classifications or summaries?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Real-World Use Cases

### Text Classification

```r
# Categorize research abstracts
abstracts %>%
  mutate(field = chat$chat(
    paste("Research field (one word):", abstract)
  ))
```

### Data Cleaning

```r
# Standardize inconsistent entries
messy_data %>%
  mutate(cleaned = chat$chat(
    paste("Standardize company name:", company_name_raw)
  ))
```

### Content Generation

```r
# Generate descriptions
products %>%
  mutate(description = chat$chat(
    paste("Write 20-word product description for:", product_name)
  ))
```

### Translation and Localization

```r
# Translate content
content %>%
  mutate(translated = chat$chat(
    paste("Translate to Spanish:", english_text)
  ))
```

## Challenge 3: Implement a Complete Workflow

Choose a scenario and implement a complete AI-enhanced pipeline:

- **Option A**: Analyze a dataset of tweets/social media posts
- **Option B**: Process customer support tickets
- **Option C**: Categorize research papers by topic

Include error handling, caching, and metadata tracking.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Example for Option B: Support Tickets

```r
library(ellmer)
library(tidyverse)

# Initialize
chat <- chat_github()

# Process tickets
process_ticket <- function(ticket_text) {
  list(
    category = safe_chat(chat, 
      paste("Category (billing/technical/account):", ticket_text)),
    priority = safe_chat(chat,
      paste("Priority (high/medium/low):", ticket_text)),
    suggested_response = safe_chat(chat,
      paste("Suggest 2-sentence response:", ticket_text))
  )
}

# Apply to dataset
tickets_processed <- tickets %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(analysis = list(process_ticket(description))) %>%
  unnest_wider(analysis)

# Save with metadata
output <- list(
  data = tickets_processed,
  metadata = list(
    processed = Sys.time(),
    model = chat$get_model(),
    n_tickets = nrow(tickets)
  )
)

write_rds(output, "processed_tickets.rds")
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Errors

- Verify your token is set correctly: 
  - `Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT_GITHUB_COM")` for RStudio setup
  - `Sys.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")` for explicit token setup from above
- Ensure token has required permissions
- Check token hasn't expired

### Rate Limiting

- Implement delays between requests: `Sys.sleep(1)`
- Use batch processing
- Consider caching results
- Monitor API usage
- Consider installation of [local models via Ollama](https://posit.co/blog/setting-up-local-llms-for-r-and-python/) for heavy workloads

### Inconsistent Results

- Make prompts more specific
- Add constraints to expected outputs
- Use [temperature parameter](https://www.vellum.ai/llm-parameters/temperature) (if supported)
- Validate and clean AI outputs
